# spctocsv
This is a program to read SPC files containing spectrum data generated by Spectroscopic instruments during experiments. This file contains a lot of headers and other bunch of information which a Physicist is least bothered about. So this program effectively reads the Spectrum data alone and writes it in a corresponding CSV(Comma Separated Values) File.
